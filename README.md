# notion-auto-pull
Bash script to automatically download a notion workspace



## In case of fire, pull lever
I made this to make sure that if notion goes under ever, I have a backup of all my historical notes in a standard (csv and md are standard, right?) format. I run this hourly on my NAS, but can easily be modified for other uses.

## Inspiration:
A lot of inspiration from the following places
*	This gitlab: https://gitlab.com/aburtsev/notion-backup-script/-/raw/master/.gitlab-ci.yml
	*	Which I found from this article: https://medium.com/@arturburtsev/automated-notion-backups-f6af4edc298d
	*	Which was made by @artjock
*	Was inspired to use the API from: https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/9jo4kp/how_create_automated_backups_of_entire_notion/
